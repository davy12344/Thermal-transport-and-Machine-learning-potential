# Machine learning models for thermal transport and structural studies

Cs2AgBiBr6: The model is based on DEEPMD, please refer to Dynamic Local Order and Ultralow Thermal Conductivity of Cs<sub>2</sub>AgBiBr<sub>6</sub> (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.4c05171)

CsCu2I3: The model is based on MTP. The cif is based on Single Crystal XRD. please refer to Incipient Ionic Conductors: Ion-Constrained Lattices Achieving Superionic-Like Thermal Conductivity Through Extreme Anharmonicity (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202513381).
